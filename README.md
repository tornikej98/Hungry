# Hungry

Are you indecisive when it comes to choosing what to eat? 

Introducing Hungry, an app designed to help you with this indecision. This app was designed to help users find random recipes to which they can choose from. Using similar UI as Tinder, its very user friendly, just having two buttons to like or dislike the recipe rendered on screen. The user can also use filters to look for certain cuisines, meal types or diets. Once a user likes a dish, it gets sent to the liked list. Here you will have the option to either favorite or delete the recipe. The user can also click on the recipe picture, directing them to the recipe details page, where they will will find a brief summary, ingredients and preparation guide. Lastly the user can leave their notes at the bottom of the details page.
